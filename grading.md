## Notes to bonus and the overall workflow

Bonus is meant to be bonus -- only benefit those who do the part but does not drag down other's grades.

After collecting the weighted grades, a curving processing will be applied -- mapping numbers grades to letter grades. Once the curving is done, those who have collected bonus points via the above listed channels, will have upgraded letter grades. In the curving stage, A is controlled to be `15% - 20%`. After adding bonus part, A-grade can be up to `40%`.
